## Simple Customisation
The theme can be customised by adding classes to the html tag like so:

```
<html lang="en" class="fix-header fun">
```

the available options so far:

### .fix-header
Keeps the logo fixed to the top when the viewport is high enough. To look good this requires a transparent logo to be provided.

### .fun
Adds a comic hand to underline the buy now button. A strategy that has been proven to drive up conversion rates by at least 65.8% on average.

### .white
Pure white background

For further customisation refere to the documentation of the [tictail template syntax](https://tictail.com/docs)
